# Installation 
1. Install Anaconda onto your computer

   Installation instructions for each operating system: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/ ](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html)https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html

2. Install the FBDD Conda environment
    
   - Open the Anaconda Prompt from Start - see https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/verify-install/#:~:text=After%20opening%20Anaconda%20Prompt%20or,Enter%20the%20command%20python%20 for help.
   - Download the FBDD_environment.yml file and store this in your local drive.
   - Run the following script in the command prompt: conda env create -f FBDD_environment.yml

4. Open Jupyter Notebook

   Open Jupyter Notebook by typing and running "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda Prompt or terminal, or by opening Anaconda Navigator and clicking the Jupyter Notebook icon.


# Input Data 
Download the "Data" folder in order to access the data files required for the model.
Save this folder in your local drive.

Example: The path used on our machine was "/Users/odilehasa/Hypertension/Final_Experiments/FINAL - October/Data"

Rename the path to indicate the location of your "Data" folder on your computer.

# Output 
Create an "Output" folder on your local drive, where all the output files will be stored. 

Example: The path used on our machine was "/Users/odilehasa/Hypertension/Final_Experiments/FINAL - October/Output"

Rename the path to indicate the location of your "Output" folder on your computer.

# Executing the Code Workbooks
Jupyter Notebook was used as the primary IDE for this model. Therefore, all the files are .ipynb to indicate jupyter notebook. However, these can be executed using other platforms, aside from Jupyter Notebook. 

The notebooks are numbered, to indicate the order in which they should be executed. The outputs of each phase should be stored in the "Output" file created above. 

Order of execution:

### Note:
Change all references to the file path to your directory where your respective folders are stored. 

Example: The path used on our machine was "/Users/odilehasa/Hypertension/Final_Experiments/FINAL - October/Output"

Rename the path to indicate the location of your "Output" folder on your computer. Do the same for the Data folder.
